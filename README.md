# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Philip 
#### I'm a full stack web developer, with some sysadmin experience. 
I've dabbled in web development for quite a few years but hadn't taken it seriously until last year. While managing Vancouver's largest dog daycare, my boss made me realise the importance of playing to your strengths. I had just been editing the company website, and thought to myself I really should be pursuing this as a full-time career as it's what I love and can naturally learn quickly. I later started a bootcamp two days after my final shift, and have been self studying since graduating.
