- 🔭 I’m currently working on **a few secret projects :), and I'm also casually working on my portfolio.** Prior to intensively learning web development in 2023, I had worked on the occasional WordPress theme and tinkered around with code/scripts for a RaspberryPI. Web development has been an underlying passion ever since buying my first HTML/CSS book at 14, but this year I have decided to throw all of my energy at it.
  
- 💬 Ask me about **life in Canada, hiking, competitive FPS gaming or chocolate!**
