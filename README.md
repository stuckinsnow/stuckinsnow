# Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Philip 

A full stack software engineer at [polymuse.tech](https://polymuse.tech/) & also currently working on a large ecommerce project. Outside of work, I'm studying a bachelors in Computer Science with plans to follow up with a masters at Georgia Tech. 

My full-time journey into development began in 2023, after completing a bootcamp. Before that, I managed Vancouverâ€™s largest dog hotel and also dedicated over 20,000 hours to competing in FPS games at a professional level. The transition to software development has felt natural; it combines the logic of gaming with the communication honed in management.

If you completed a bootcamp or are a university graduate based in Canada, the UK or the USA, I am currently building a tech community. The site is being remade!
