# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Philip 
#### I'm a full stack web developer, with some sysadmin experience. 
I've dabbled in web development for quite a few years but hadn't taken it seriously until last year. While managing Vancouver's largest dog daycare, my boss made me realise the importance of playing to your strengths. I had just been editing the company website, and thought to myself I really should be pursuing this as a full-time career as it's what I love and can naturally learn quickly. I later started a bootcamp two days after my final shift, and have been self studying since graduating.

Lastly, I am a photographer but I have stopped taking it seriously! I originally pursued this hobby to prove to myself I could get good at something I had no hidden talent at, and I've enjoyed it since. I still don't think it comes as naturally to me as coding, but it's a nice and relaxing hobby: [photocasa.net](https://photocasa.net). It has taught me a lot about colour theory and lighting. I have found this quite useful when designing projects.
